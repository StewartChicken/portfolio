		<p id = "txtbody">
			My name is Evan Poon. I am currently attending the University of Colorado at Boulder and am pursuing Bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Applie Mathematics as well as a Traditional Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering. I have always held a passion for math and programming and have worked with computers all my life. I enjoy problem solving and anything that requires critical thinking. I spend a lot of my free time reading and learning new things.

		<h3 id = "title">Work Experience/Project History</h3>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			As far as my work experience extends, I worked at my uncle’s Law Firm as a file manager/organizer from 7th to 12th grade (2017-2022) where I was responsible for managing/maintaining the organization of the firm’s file system. I would retrieve/stow specific files for employees/attorneys, close cases that were designated as “to-be-closed”, ensure each file cabinet was organized alphabetically, scan closed physical files to create more storage space, and rearrange the physical organization of the system to increase accessibilty. Overall, I would maintain the organization of the file system and if anybody needed assistance with the system, I was the person to ask. <br><br>

			I am presently worked for CU Boulder's Space Grant Consortium which looked to give students hands on experience with engineering and the design process. Through this program, I have earned lots of experience working with others to build and design projects. The first project we built was a small DemoSat "payload" which was sent to space to collect various data and readings. The second (and current) project is to design a space craft for NASA's annual RASC-AL competition. The competition's participants were tasked with creating a multi-use platform which will aide future lunar missions.

			In my coding experience, I have had exposure to several different branches of programming and software engineering as well as a variety of different languages, a majority of which are listed below.

		<h3 id = "title">Goals</h3>

		<p id = "txtbody">
			Over the course of the next five years I hope to learn as much as I can about any topics that interest me. Much of my time will be spent studying the math and processes that allow computers to function in the ways that they do. I hope to learn how they work on both high and low levels, as well as how they can be optimized to work ever-more efficiently. I hope to one day have the opportunity to adequately contribute to a team of engineers and thinkers who strive towards a brighter and more technologically sufficient future.
