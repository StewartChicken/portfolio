# My-Website
This repository contains the code for my personal website

I created this website project with the hope of granting others a little bit of insight into who I am and what I have accomplished, as well as what my goals are. The webThis website will include information about myself as well as all of my major programming/embedded systems projects. I intend to discuss my future goals/project ideas. The website is composed of very rudimentary HTML and CSS, as I am not very well versed in these languages. I may include some JavaScript in the future to spice things up.
